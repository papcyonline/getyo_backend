## 🧠 How Your PA Understands You

### Natural Language Processing
Your PA uses advanced AI to understand:

1. **Natural Dates & Times**
   - "tomorrow at 3pm" → Actual date/time
   - "in 2 hours" → Calculated time
   - "next Monday" → Correct future date
   - "every day at 9am" → Recurring pattern

2. **Context Awareness**
   - "Schedule a call with the team" = Meeting (not just calendar event)
   - "Email John about this" = References conversation context
   - "High priority" = Detects urgency automatically

3. **Smart Extraction**
   - Automatically extracts emails from context
   - Infers meeting duration if not specified
   - Detects priority from your tone
   - Categorizes notes intelligently

## 📊 What Happens Behind The Scenes

When you chat with your PA:

1. **Intent Detection** - AI analyzes what you want to do
2. **Data Extraction** - Pulls out all relevant details
3. **Action Execution** - Creates the items in your database
4. **Confirmation** - Tells you what was done

**Example Flow:**
```
You: "Remind me to call John at 4pm tomorrow, and schedule a Zoom meeting
      for the team standup at 9am on Monday"

PA analyzes → Detects 2 actions:
  1. Reminder: Call John
  2. Meeting: Team standup

PA creates both → Confirms:
  "✅ I've set a reminder to call John tomorrow at 4pm, and scheduled
   a Zoom meeting for team standup on Monday at 9am!"
```

## 🎨 Multiple Actions In One Request

Your PA can handle **multiple actions** in a single conversation:

**Example:**
> "Add a task to finish the report, remind me to call Sarah at 3pm,
> and schedule a Google Meet for Friday's review session with the team"

**PA creates:**
1. ✅ Task: Finish the report
2. ✅ Reminder: Call Sarah at 3pm
3. ✅ Meeting: Friday's review session
