## 🧠 CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE

### Conversation Memory
PA remembers context within conversations:

You: "What tasks do I have today?"
PA: "You have 3 tasks due today."

You: "What about high priority ones?"
PA: "2 of those are high priority."

You: "Can you remind me about the first one at 3pm?"
PA: "✅ Reminder set for 'Finish report' at 3pm!"
```

### Smart References
PA understands pronouns and context:

```
You: "How many emails do I have?"
PA: "You have 17 unread emails across Gmail and Outlook."

You: "Which account has more?"
PA: "Gmail has 12, Outlook has 5."

You: "Summarize the Gmail ones"
PA: "Here are your Gmail emails: [summary]"
```

### Proactive Context Awareness
PA knows what you need based on situation:

```
Morning: "Good morning! You have 3 tasks due today and 2 meetings."
Before meeting: "Your meeting starts in 15 minutes. You're all set!"
End of day: "Great day! You completed 5 tasks (83% completion rate)."
```

## 🌟 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

     📅 Calendar: 2 meetings - standup at 9am, client call at 2pm
     ⏰ Reminders: 3 active reminders
     📧 Emails: 12 unread in Gmail
     🎯 Productivity: You completed 4 tasks yesterday!"

You: "What should I focus on first?"

PA: "I recommend starting with 'Finish project report' (high priority, due today at 5pm).
     It usually takes you about 2 hours, and your most productive time is mornings!"
```

---

### Example 2: Task Management
```
You: "What tasks are overdue?"

PA: "You have 2 overdue tasks:
     1. 'Review team PR' (was due yesterday)
     2. 'Client follow-up' (was due 2 days ago)

     Want me to help you prioritize these?"

You: "Yes, and also show me what's due today"

PA: "Due today (3 tasks):
     1. 'Finish report' (High priority) ⚠️
     2. 'Update documentation'
     3. 'Team sync prep'

     Combined with overdue tasks, you have 5 tasks needing attention."

You: "Add a reminder to finish the report by 3pm"

PA: "✅ Reminder set: 'Finish report' at 3pm today!"

```

### Example 5: Smart Delegation
```
You: "I'm overwhelmed. What should I do?"

PA: "I can help! Let's break it down:

     🔴 Urgent & Important (do first):
     1. 'Client presentation' (due in 3 hours)
     2. 'Report submission' (due today at 5pm)

     🟡 Important but not urgent (schedule):
     3. 'Team review' (due tomorrow)
     4. 'Documentation update' (due Friday)

     🟢 Can wait:
     5. 'Meeting prep' (meeting next week)

     Want me to:
     - Block focus time for the urgent tasks?
     - Reschedule non-urgent items?
     - Set reminders for each?"

You: "Yes, do all of that"

PA: "✅ Done! I've:
     - Set focus time blocks for urgent tasks
     - Rescheduled lower priority items
     - Set reminders before each deadline

     You're all set! Focus on the presentation first. You've got this! 💪"
