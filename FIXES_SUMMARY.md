# ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE!

## Issue 1: Tasks Not Appearing
**Problem:** "Find me 10 best affordable hotels in Dubai" - PA responded but no task appeared

**Root Cause:** Task model expects `"in-progress"` (with hyphen) but controller was using `"in_progress"` (underscore)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Changed status from `'in_progress'` to `'in-progress'` in controller
- ✅ Backend now creates visible task immediately when assignment is created
- ✅ Task updates automatically when assignment completes

**Result:** Task appears instantly with 🔍 icon and updates when done

---

## Issue 2: Swipe-to-Delete Not Working
**Problem:** Swipe left/right on tasks did nothing

**Root Causes:**
1. Status filter mismatch (`'in_progress'` vs `'in-progress'`)
2. Edit handler just showed alert instead of editing

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Fixed all status references to use `'in-progress'` (with hyphen)
- ✅ Edit now navigates to TaskDetail screen in edit mode
- ✅ Delete works with confirmation dialog

**Result:** Swipe right = Edit, Swipe left = Delete

---

## Issue 3: Notifications Not Showing
**Problem:** Assignments complete in background but no notification appears

**Root Cause:** Notification screen only refreshes when opened or manually pulled down

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added auto-polling every 10 seconds while on notification screen
- ✅ Tapping AI research notification shows full findings
- ✅ Added getAssignment API method to fetch research results

**Result:** Notifications auto-refresh and show full research when tapped
