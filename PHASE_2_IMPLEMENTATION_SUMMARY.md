# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. UserProfile Model (`src/models/UserProfile.ts`)
**Purpose**: Store persistent learning data for each user

**Key Fields:**
- Communication preferences (style, length, greeting)
- Work hours and work days
- Relationships (family, friends, colleagues)
- Common tasks (detected patterns)
- Learning metadata (success/failure counts, learning score)
- User preferences (liked/disliked suggestions, forbidden topics)

**Methods:**
- `calculateLearningScore()` - Computes 0-100 intelligence score
- `generateAIPromptSummary()` - Creates context for AI prompts

### 2. Feedback Model (`src/models/Feedback.ts`)
**Purpose**: Collect user ratings and response quality data

**Key Fields:**
- Rating (1-5 stars)
- Feedback type (positive/negative/neutral)
- Specific issues (incorrect_action, wrong_tone, etc.)
- Expected vs. actual response
- Actions created and their correctness
- Performance metrics (response time, token usage)

**Static Methods:**
- `getHighQualityExamples()` - Get 4-5 star responses for fine-tuning
- `getProblematicExamples()` - Get 1-2 star responses for improvement
- `getUserAverageRating()` - Calculate user's average rating

### 3. ProfileLearningService (`src/services/ProfileLearningService.ts`)
**Purpose**: Learn from user behavior and update profiles

**Key Methods:**
- `getOrCreateProfile()` - Fetch or create user profile
- `learnWorkHours()` - Analyze task completion patterns (needs 20+ tasks)
- `learnCommonTasks()` - Extract recurring patterns
- `learnRelationship()` - Remember important people
- `updateCommunicationPreferences()` - Adjust formality and length
- `recordSuccess() / recordFailure()` - Track interaction quality
- `getProfileSummary()` - Generate AI prompt context
- `runFullAnalysis()` - Run all learning algorithms (daily job)

### 4. Feedback API Routes (`src/routes/feedback.ts`)
**Purpose**: API endpoints for feedback collection

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback on PA response
- `GET /api/feedback/history` - Get user's feedback history (paginated)
- `GET /api/feedback/stats` - Get average rating and statistics

**Authentication:** All routes require `authenticateToken` middleware

### 5. Updated Optimized OpenAI Service (`src/services/optimizedOpenAIService.ts`)
**Changes:**
- Fetch user profile before generating response
- Detect user mood (urgent, positive, negative)
- Inject learned preferences into prompt context
- Append profile summary to system prompt
- Result: **Personalized responses** based on learned data

### 6. Updated Optimized Controller (`src/controllers/optimizedConversationController.ts`)
**Changes:**
- Import ProfileLearningService
- Record successful interactions after response
- Learn communication preferences from message
- Update profile in background (doesn't slow down response)

### 7. Updated Modular Prompts (`src/prompts/modularPrompts.ts`)
**Changes:**
- `GREETING_BEHAVIOR` now uses learned preferred greeting and style
- `CONVERSATION_TONE` adapts to formal/casual based on profile
- Dynamic prompt generation based on user preferences

### 8. Profile Learning Job (`src/jobs/profileLearningJob.ts`)
**Purpose**: Background job that runs daily to analyze user behavior

**Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM (cron: `0 2 * * *`)

**Process:**
1. Get all active users
2. For each user, run full profile analysis:
   - Learn work hours from task completion patterns
   - Extract common tasks from Pattern model
3. Log results and errors

**Manual Trigger:** `profileLearningJob.triggerNow()`

### 9. Registered New Job (`src/jobs/index.ts`)
**Changes:**
- Import `profileLearningJob`
- Initialize in job scheduler
- Runs alongside existing jobs (pattern detection, forgotten activity)

## ðŸ”„ How It Works (End-to-End)

### User Sends Message
```
1. User: "Could you please remind me about the meeting?"
   â†“
2. Controller receives message
   â†“
3. Fetch UserProfile (learns: user prefers formal communication)
   â†“
4. Build personalized prompt:
   - CORE_IDENTITY (with user's name)
   - GREETING_BEHAVIOR (formal style, preferred greeting)
   - ACTION_CLASSIFICATION (detecting "remind" keyword)
   - CLARIFICATION_RULES (missing time)
   - CONVERSATION_TONE (professional and respectful)
   â†“
5. Inject profile summary:
   "USER PROFILE:
    - Prefers formal communication
    - Works Mon-Fri 9am-5pm
    - Important relationship: Mom (family, high importance)"
   â†“
6. Single AI call with personalized prompt
   â†“
7. AI Response (JSON):
   {
     "needsClarification": true,
     "clarificationNeeded": "What time would you like to be reminded?",
     "conversationalResponse": "Certainly! What time would you like to be reminded about the meeting?"
   }
   â†“
8. Save to conversation
   â†“
9. LEARNING PHASE:
   - Record successful interaction
   - Detect formality: "Could you please" â†’ formal detected
   - Update profile: maintain/increase formal preference
   â†“
10. Return response to user
   â†“
11. [Optional] User rates response (5 stars) â†’ Positive feedback recorded
```

### Daily Background Learning
```
2:00 AM Daily:
1. Profile Learning Job runs
   â†“
2. For each user:
   - Fetch last 30 days of completed tasks
   - Analyze completion times â†’ Extract work hours (9am-5pm)
   - Analyze completion days â†’ Extract work days (Mon-Fri)
   - Fetch active patterns â†’ Extract common tasks
   â†“
3. Update UserProfile with learned data
   â†“
4. Next day: PA knows user's work schedule and won't send reminders outside work hours
```

### Proactive Reminders
```
Every 15 minutes:
1. Forgotten Activity Job runs
   â†“
2. For each user:
   - Check active patterns (e.g., "Daily standup notes" at 9:00 AM weekdays)
   - If pattern expected but not executed:
     â†“
     Send notification: "Hey Boss! Did you forget your daily standup notes?"
```

## ðŸ“Š Learning Timeline

| Time | What PA Learns | Data Required |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Immediate** (1-3 messages) | Formality preference, message length preference | User messages |
| **Short-term** (10-20 messages) | Communication style, preferred greeting | Conversation history |
| **Medium-term** (20-50 tasks over 2-4 weeks) | Work hours, work days | Completed tasks |
| **Long-term** (50+ tasks, 100+ messages) | Common tasks, relationships, habits | Task patterns, mentions in conversations |

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Profile Creation
- [ ] Send a message
- [ ] Check if UserProfile was created: `UserProfile.findOne({ userId })`
- [ ] Verify default values: `communicationStyle: 'balanced'`, `learningScore: 0`

### Test 2: Communication Learning
- [ ] Send formal message: "Could you please create a task?"
- [ ] Check profile: `communicationStyle` should move toward 'formal'
- [ ] Send next message, verify PA responds more formally

### Test 3: Feedback System
- [ ] Submit 5-star feedback via `/api/feedback`
- [ ] Check feedback was saved: `Feedback.findOne({ userId })`
- [ ] Verify `feedbackType: 'positive'`
- [ ] Check stats: `/api/feedback/stats` should show average rating

### Test 4: Work Hours Learning
- [ ] Create 20+ tasks with `completedAt` timestamps (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri)
- [ ] Trigger profile learning: `profileLearningJob.triggerNow()`
- [ ] Check profile: `workHours` should be populated (9am-5pm, days [1,2,3,4,5])

### Test 5: Proactive Reminders
- [ ] Create a recurring pattern (e.g., "Daily standup" every weekday 9am)
- [ ] Wait until pattern time + 15 minutes without completing it
- [ ] Check notifications: Should receive forgotten activity reminder

### Test 6: Personalized Responses
- [ ] Set profile: `preferredGreeting: "Hello Chief!"`
- [ ] Send greeting: "Hey"
- [ ] PA should respond with "Hello Chief!" instead of default

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics to Monitor

### Quality Metrics
```typescript
// Average rating over time
const stats = await Feedback.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$createdAt" } },
      avgRating: { $avg: "$rating" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { _id: -1 } },
  { $limit: 30 }
]);

// Goal: avgRating >= 4.0 consistently
```

### Learning Metrics
```typescript
// Profiles with learned data
const profileStats = await UserProfile.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      hasWorkHours: { $cond: ["$workHours.enabled", 1, 0] },
      commonTasksCount: { $size: "$commonTasks" },
      learningScore: 1
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avgLearningScore: { $avg: "$learningScore" },
      usersWithWorkHours: { $sum: "$hasWorkHours" },
      avgCommonTasks: { $avg: "$commonTasksCount" }
    }
  }
]);

// Goal: avgLearningScore > 40 after 1 month
```

### Proactivity Metrics
```typescript
// Forgotten activity reminders sent
const reminderCount = await Notification.countDocuments({
  type: 'forgotten_activity',
  createdAt: { $gte: last30Days }
});

// Goal: Reminders lead to task completion (track completion rate)
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profile not learning formality
**Symptom:** User sends formal messages but `communicationStyle` stays 'casual'

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Check if learning is being called
// In optimizedConversationController.ts, add logs:
logger.info('[Learning] Message length:', messageLength);
logger.info('[Learning] Formality detected:', formalityDetected);

// Check profile updates
const profile = await UserProfile.findOne({ userId });
logger.info('[Learning] Current style:', profile.communicationStyle);
```

**Solution:** Ensure `updateCommunicationPreferences` logic is correct (needs 3+ formal messages to shift style)

### Issue: Work hours not being learned
**Symptom:** Profile `workHours.enabled` is false despite many completed tasks

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Check task count
const taskCount = await Task.countDocuments({
  userId,
  status: 'completed',
  completedAt: { $exists: true }
});
logger.info('[Learning] Completed tasks:', taskCount);

// Manually trigger learning
await ProfileLearningService.learnWorkHours(userId);
```

**Solution:** Need at least 20 completed tasks with valid `completedAt` timestamps

### Issue: Feedback not being recorded
**Symptom:** `/api/feedback` returns success but no feedback in database

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Check if feedback model is being saved
const feedback = await Feedback.findOne({ userId, messageId });
logger.info('[Feedback] Saved feedback:', feedback);
```

**Solution:** Ensure `messageId` is being passed correctly from frontend

## ðŸŽ‰ Impact Summary

### Before Phase 2
- PA had no memory between sessions
- Generic responses for all users
- No quality tracking
- Purely reactive

### After Phase 2
- PA remembers preferences forever
- Personalized responses per user
- 1-5 star ratings for quality tracking
- Proactive reminders for forgotten activities
- Gets smarter over time

**Result**: PA is now a **self-improving, proactive companion** that learns from every interaction! ðŸš€
